#  Exploratory Data Analysis – Student Performance

 ## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world student performance dataset to understand academic trends, distributions, and influencing factors.

##  Dataset
- Source: Students Performance in Exams (Kaggle)
- Records: 1000 students
- Features include gender, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, and exam scores.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Data quality checks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistical analysis
- Data visualization (bar chart, histogram, box plot, heatmap)
- Pattern discovery and insight generation
- Final conclusions and future scope

##  Key Insights
- Reading and writing scores show strong positive correlation.
- Students who completed test preparation courses performed better.
- Math scores exhibited higher variability compared to other subjects.
- Socio-economic indicators like lunch type influenced performance.

##  Future Scope
- Build machine learning models to predict student performance.
- Perform feature engineering on categorical variables.
